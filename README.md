# Introduction:
Violence against women is common in Bangladesh and is not a new phenomenon, similar in nature to many of its South Asian neighbors. But today, its magnitude tends to
be alarming, particularly in rural areas, generally among the poorer section. Although the Constitution of Bangladesh guarantees equal rights to all citizens, laws relating to family matters such as marriage, divorce, custody, maintenance, and inheritance discriminate against women. It is contradictions such as these that exacerbate the issue of violence against women in the region. On the other hand, depression has become another reason of committing suicide among people in recent years. So, the solution for communication, dedicated to this sector has become essential for those who are being harassed and need emotional support.

This project aims to automate the communication among all the people who have become a victim of sexual harassment. From a person seeking emotional and lawyer
support, to enrolling in self-defense course, can be an active part of our system.
